I woke up feeling rested after getting about 8 hours of sleep. \n            Had my usual coffee this morning and felt energized for my workout. Did a 30-minute run and felt great afterwards.\n            Work was busy with a few meetings, but nothing too stressful. \n            Had lunch with a colleague which was nice and relaxing.\n            In the evening, I did some yoga to wind down and prepare for bed.\n            Feeling grateful and looking forward to tomorrow.",
