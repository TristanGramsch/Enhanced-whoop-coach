# Data Intelligence

This module now powers a standalone, multipage dashboard (separate from the main frontend, which simply links to it) for long‑term recovery analytics and forecasts. It materializes versioned JSON/CSV artifacts under `shared/outputs/` (trends, volatility, seasonality, correlations and lag effects, anomalies, data quality, forecasts with prediction intervals, backtests, and live tracking) and integrates with MLflow for experiment tracking, metrics, artifacts, and model registry. The dashboard reads these artifacts to render decision‑ready views—summarizing 30/90‑day behavior, drivers, and risks—while the API/orchestrator can trigger recomputation so insights remain reproducible and up to date.
